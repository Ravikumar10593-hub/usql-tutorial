## Verify That it Was Installed

## The DATA LAKE menu item

Even though ADL Tools for VS is installed, you will not see the DATA LAKE menu item. It will appear only if you use a Data Lake feature.

The simplest way of quickly bringing up the menu item, is to navigate to Tools &gt; Options and then simply click Azure Data Lake.
