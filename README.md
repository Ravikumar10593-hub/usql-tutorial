## How to Read this document

Set aside a day or two and just start reading each chapter in sequence. Every chapter introduces a simple topic. Don’t skip ahead. Each chapter builds on the one before it. When you are done with all the chapters you’ll have a good working grasp of how to use U-SQL.

## Looking for the U-SQL Language Reference?

The goal of this document is to rapidly give a reader competence with U-SQL, not to be a language reference. You can find [**the language reference here**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt591959.aspx).
