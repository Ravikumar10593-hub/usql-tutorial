# U-SQL compared to SQL

If you come from a SQL background, you'll notice that U-SQL queries look a lot of SQL queries. Many fundamental concepts and syntactic expressions will be very familiar to those with a background in SQL.

However U-SQL is a distinct language and some of the expectations you might have from the SQL world do not carry over into U-SQL.
