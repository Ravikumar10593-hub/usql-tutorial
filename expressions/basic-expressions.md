# Useful expressions

If you are a C# developer, the expressions below will seem obvious. If you have a SQL background or come from another language, please read this section. It will save you a lot of time later.


### if null, pick a default value, otherwise use the value

```
stringcol1 ?? "defval"
```

The `??` is the C# null coalescing operator.

### if an expression is true, pick one value, otherwise pick a different one

```
<expr> ? "was_true" : "was_false"
```

### if an expression is true, pick one value, otherwise pick a different one

```
<expr> ? "was_true" : "was_false"
```
